Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. They have applications in many computer science applications. Basically, searching algorithms allow the user to find a target element given the list of elements. In fact, we can use two common searching techniques â€“ The Linear Search and Binary Search to find the search target.
